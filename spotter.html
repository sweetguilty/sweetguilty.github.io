        <center> <h1> Overview</h1></center>
        <center><p>This project was the result of a 48-hour Hackathon, collaborating with developers. The main goal was to design and build a reponsive website that pulls data out of a database and allows users to insert data into the database.<br />
            <br />
            My team consisted of two developers and two designers. I took on the role of a UI designer; designing the style guide, the wireframes, and prototying from scratch.
            <br />
            <br />
            Tools used: Trello, Miro, Figma, Adobe Illustrator

        <center><p>Grace is a driver in Toronto who feels fed up with expensive parking fees around the city. She‚Äôs an independent individual who occasionally finds sweet free parking spots around the city and wishes she had a way to remember the locations.

          She already shared a couple of her spots with her friends, but why don‚Äôt we just make this process a lot easier for her by developing a platform that meets her needs?</p> </center>
                <img class="logo" src="images/spotter/logo.png" alt="" />
                <center><p>Introducing Spotter, a web based platform and sharing community which allows users to find, share and leave parking spot reviews.</p> </center>

    <center><p>Taking a look at Grace‚Äôs needs, our team focused our design on five key features.</p> </center>

  <p>

    Ultimately, we wanted our users to feel at ease and comfortable when using our app. So we avoided anything visually aggravating and took accessiblity into consideration by not picking red or green (colour blindness).
    <br />
    Ubuntu font was picked because it was an all rounded corner font which give a soft and friendly vibe, while different shades of blue was picked as it represented calm, stability and reliability.

  <!--  Took accessbility into consideration and avoided colours prone to colour blindness such as red or green. We picked different shades of blue, because blue is a calming, relaxing, cool colour that is often associated with serenity, trust, stability and reliability. We also used Ubuntu font because the corners are literally all rounded which gives a soft and friendly vibe to users. Ultimately we wanted our users to feel at ease and comfortable when using our app and nothing to be visually aggravating. -->

  <p>
    Based on WCAG standard guide, my design successfully passed the colour contrast check for AA 18pt and is fully colour compliant. However, it failed to pass the AA for font below 18pt and how readable my text is for people with colour blindness.<br />
  <br />
My next step would be to change my foreground colour to darker gray which would have a contrast ratio of AAA and the colour would be suiteable for colour blind users.

    Some features we wanted to add for this hackathon but could not are:
  </p></center>
  <p>
  1. Notify users to let them know when to move their car.<br />
  2. Track which spots are available in real time. <br />
  3. Help users find the best rate <br />
  4. Airbnb, but for parking spots. (Option for users to rent our their parking spot and generate revenue) <br />
  </p>

<center><h1>Learning</h1></center>
<p>
  <center>As a designer, I had many extra features that I wanted to add, however, after talking to the developers, I learned that due to time and technical constraints not every idea would be feasible. Going forward, it will be important to be cognizant of these constraints when designing, to avoid scope creep.</center><br />
    <center>
One of my developer made a unilateral decision without telling the designers which could have been mitigated with regular checkins. Thus, <b>regular and consistent communication</b> is key when you are working in a team project, especially if you are working cross-functionally.</center>

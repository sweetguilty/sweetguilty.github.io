<br />

                 <p>
                  This is my very first project, where I identify a user need in the daily lives of one of my peers. Anything from behavioural to habitual. Once I found a problem, I had to propose to my user a solution that met their needs.

                  </p>
    <p> <h4> How it all started...</h4>
      A simple question: "Tell me about your day today?" Upon listening to my user, I discovered that my user had to almost throw out an eggplant because they forgot that it had been in the fridge for awhile. This intrigued me - how could this happen? Do others experience this too? Can we prevent this from happening again in the future?
      <br />

    </p>

<div>  <h2><u> Meet Janice</u></h2> </div>
    <img src="images/Chef Smart/janice.png" alt=""/>
    <p>
       Due to the pandemic and the curfew laws set in her province, she has more of a reason to be a sporadic bulk grocery buyer. Janice tries to buy a lot and she tries to finish everything within one week. This generally leads ingredients to spoil.
    </p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
  <div><h2><u>Problem Statement</u></h2> </div>
  <p>
    Janice, a sporadic bulk buyer and home cook loves to cook, however she often finds herself throwing out spoiled ingredients. She wishes she had some way to know when an ingredient is about to spoil and what dishes she can make without investing extra time.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <div><h2><u>Competitive Analysis</u></h2> </div>
  <br />
  <br />
    <img class="evernote" src="images/Chef Smart/evernote2.png" alt=""/>
    <p>
  Janice usually keeps track of her ingredients via memory or on sight (i.e. looking in the fridge), but these methods have not been helping her. Upon investigating further, I found that she uses Evernote (a basic app that allows users to create a to-do-list) to do her grocery shopping. But this app is very broad and unspecialized, and Janice finds it time-consuming to make a list.
    </p>
                    <img class="evernote" src="images/Chef Smart/expensify.png" alt=""/>
          <p>
            Another competitor is Expensify, which allows users to save time by taking a picture of their receipts to upload and track their spending digitally, while simultaneously adding the total up as well. But these apps are not enough to solve Janice's concern and they do not cater towards home-chefs.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

  <div><h2><u>Ideating & Feedback</u></h2> </div>
  <img class="feedback" src="images/Chef Smart/feedback.png" alt=""/>
    <div><h2><u>Solution Statement</u></h2> </div>
    <p>
  By improving on existing solutions, we can create an app that will alert home cooks when their ingredients are about to expire, while also recommending a recipe and is as hands-off as possible.
    </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <div><h2><u>Sketches</u></h2> </div>
    <img class="sketches" src="images/Chef Smart/sketches.jpg" alt=""/>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
        <div><h2><u>Iterations</u></h2> </div>
        <p>
          After having my user test out my sketched out prototype, I made three changes before creating my block wireframes.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>1) Some receipts require more than one picture to catch everything. </b>
          <br /><br />
Some examples of this could be a long receipt or multiple different receipts.
My initial sketched out wireframes only included one picture of the receipt before it generated a list.
      <img class="iteration" src="images/Chef Smart/iteration1.png" alt=""/>
    </p> But now, my iteration allows user to take or upload as many pictures or screenshots of their receipt as required. </p>

  <img class="iteration" src="images/Chef Smart/iteration2.png" alt=""/>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
    <b>2) What if the system is unable to identify an item or categorize it properly after scanning a receipt? </b>
    <br />
  </p> My initial sketch wireframes assumed that machine learning would detect everything successfully. But realistically, it is not 100% possible. </p>
  <img class="iteration" src="images/Chef Smart/iteration3.png" alt=""/>
  <br />
    <p>
      So I added an option for Janice to quickly and easily manually edit them in that case. The app will notify her and show in red what the system was unable to do.
    </p>
      <img class="iteration" src="images/Chef Smart/iteration4.png" alt=""/>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>3) Many apps will have a functional landing page, for example a newsfeed page for Facebook. </b>

    </p> I had iterated on my initial landing page visually, however after performing usability testing I realized that my landing page had no functionality at all (second  wireframe). It just had my app logo and a menu button bar. It served no purpose, so the landing page was changed to the list page with all the other features added to the menu icon. </p>
    <img class="iteration" src="images/Chef Smart/iteration5.png" alt=""/>
        <p>
        Now my landing page will be the page where Janice can find her list; this will in turn increase app functionality and efficiency.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <div><h2><u>User Flow</u></h2> </div>
      <img class="userflow" src="images/Chef Smart/userflow.jpg" alt=""/>

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
      <div><h2><u>Learning</u></h2> </div>
      From this project, I got to really learn the importance of usability testing and feedback. I did not realize that I was designing an app that my user would not want to use until I performed testing. Rapid iteration and constant usability testing is irreplaceable!

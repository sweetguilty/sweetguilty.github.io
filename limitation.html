<h2>We tried, but it just wouldn't work...</h2>
<br /><br />
  <p> Our users expressed how the UI features would often block their screen when they would be sharing their screen. So our team tried to tackle this issue of limited monitor space by dynamically reducing the screen's aspect ratio and adding the UI on the side. However, we found out through competitive research that none of the other platforms have this feature available, because it is technically impossible to implement.  </p>
    <!--Through competitive analysis on competitors such as Google Meet and Discord, we found that our original sketch which tried to solve the problem with limited monitor space was not possible from a technical standpoint. This technical limitation was confirmed by developers to be an operatng system limitation.--->

<h2>Technical limitation explained:</h2><br />
<br />
<!---Currently on Zoom, we can share a program, a window or a tab on Zoom, but we cannot selectively share a portion of our screen. We can share a program, because we are sharing the entire thing, however we cannot share a screen and crop the rest out. We cannot forcebly shrink our screen and put a side bar on the side. This would also create a recursive effect which would be jarring for our users.---->
  <p>
 The change in aspect ratio would have to involve not only Zoom, but also the  operating system provider (such as Microsoft and Apple) would have to implement or give permission for applications such as Zoom to change its operating system, which would be a huge security risk for them. <br /><br />Furthermore, altering that screen that is being shared while sharing that same screen can result in numerous jarring effects - such as a recursive screen or cognitive dissonance (i.e. what's being shared doesn't match what's on your screen).

  This case study was a project that consisted of two week-long sprints, where I had to analyze iOS users’ behaviour and determine if an iOS stock application could be improved. The goal was to identify users needs and use a feature-focused approach to address those needs within the stock application.

  <div class="col-sm-10 col-lg-8">
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      Launched in 2015, Apple Music is a subscription based music streaming platform.
      I picked Apple Music because many loyal iOS users were intentionally uninstalling Apple Music for other third party applications such as Spotify and YouTube Music. This inspired me to look deeper into what were some frustrations users were facing and how I could modify Apple Music to resolve these issues.

      <h1 class="header1">Problem</h1>
      <p class="white-text">
        <b>1) Tab Bar<br /></b>
        The tab bar was unnecessarily cluttered. Labels were unclear and redundant, thus causing confusion among users.
        <br /><br />
        <b>2) Search feature</b>
        <br />
        The UI for the search function was overly complex, requiring users to proceed with caution during use.  </p> <br /><br />

    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
      <h1 class="header1">Hypothesis</h1>
      <p class="white-text"> I believe that by reducing the number of options in the tab bar, changing the labelling, and by giving users quick and easy access to the search function, we will improve the users experience by providing a more streamlined task flow.</p>

    <br />
    <p>I redesigned the tab bar by reducing the number of options and changing the labels - making it more straightforward to navigate. Second, I adjusted the search bar function entirely to make it more intuitive and improve accessibility.</p>

      <h1 class="header">User Research</h1>
      <p class="white-text">
        In total, I interviewed 10 users for this project, via user interviews and contextual inquiries. Users were recruited through my designer peers and through social media advertising.<br /><br />
  While conducting additional rounds of interviews, I discovered that there were two kinds of users on Apple Music: users who are subscribers - and thus use the streaming service -, and free users - who use it to listen to their own downloaded music.

  <br />
  <h1 class="header"> Synthesizing</h1>

  Using affinity mapping, I synthesized my research and identified five problems. However, in order have a sense of focus, I prioritized the two that the users found the most ubiquitous.</p>

    <h1 class="header">Competitive Research</h1><br /><br />

  <p>
A competitive analysis was done to understand how other platforms structured their tab bars as well as how they placed their search function within their interface.</p><br />
<h3> What I found...</h3>
<br /><p>

I unraveled that compared to Spotify and YouTube Music, Apple Music had the most icons/options on their tab bar as well as having the most complex search system due to having a multi-step search process. Compared to Apple Music, users of other platforms have an easier time utilising the search function due to lower complexity, allowing them to quickly locate their favourite songs</p>
<br />
</section>
<div><img class="image2" src=images/apple-music/competitive.png></div>
  <section class="process2">
<h1 class="header"> Online Survey</h1><br>
<p>
I made an online survey to better understand how users felt about the current tab bar and the search function. The survey was really the most eye opening part of the project, because it really gave me a lot of insights on how the users perceived the problem very differently from how I did originally.</p><br /><br />
<h4> Insight #1: Users said that five icons was too much and the majority preferred three icons.
</h4>
<img class="image3" src=images/apple-music/survey1.png>
<br /><br /><br />
<h4>
Insight #2:

Users felt the icons were redundant or had inaccurrate labelling</b>
</h4><br /><br />
<img class="image3" src=images/apple-music/survey2.png>
<br /><br />
<p>
</p><br />
<div class="row">
  <div class="insight2 col-xs-12 col-lg-6"><br /><br />
    <p>
    A)  I found that many users expressed that they were very confused and misled by the Browse and Search labels, as they sound like they would serve the same function.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="insight2.1 col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
    <img class="image3" src=images/apple-music/tabbar.png><br />

    <br />
    <img class="image3" src=images/apple-music/search.png>
  </div>
</div><br />

<p>
  B) Many users expressed in the survey how the Listen Now and Browse labels looked very similar and felt that it was unnecessary to have two separate tabs that served the same function. Surprisingly, a few users suggested combining the two pages to prevent clutter. This idea can also be seen on Spotify, where a Home page covers both Listen now and Browse pages.
</p>
<br />

<p>
C) 100% of my online survey participants said that they wished to see the Radio page removed from the tab bar and relocated to a category section as it was their most underused icon. Users also expressed how they did not like the Radio icon at the center of the tab bar as they felt that the center spot should be given priority to icons that were most used.
</p>
<br /><br /><br />
<h4>
  Insight #3:

  Label confusion for "Listen Now" aka Music suggested for you.</b>
</h4>
<br /><br />
<p>
  <i>"I think that Listen Now doesn't have to have a separate icon as there's already the current music playing bar right above this tab bar." (Unsubscribed User)<br /><br />


"The Listen Now first confused me because I thought it was talking about the song I was currently listening to. But I found out it was just a recommendation page." (Subscribed user)</i>
</p><br />
<img class="image3" src=images/apple-music/listennow.png>
<br /><br />
<p>
  The comments above stood out to me, as both made the assumption that “Listen Now” page was a Now Playing page. In addition, not only was the labeling misleading, but unsubscribed users also did not know what Listen Now actually was. Upon further inquiry, I discovered that unsubscribed users didn't even have access to the page - as Listen Now was actually hidden behind a paywall-esque landing page. This was very a important discovery as it helped me to iterate my sketched out wireframes later on. *Refer to Sketching & Iterations section below.
</p>
<br /><br /><br />
<h4> Apple Search Function</h4>
<br /><br />
<img class="image3" src=images/apple-music/search2.png><br /><br />
<p>
  One of the main problems users expressed is how the Apple Music search interface is based on a system where you need to pick a specific location to search. You need to either pick the Apple Music catalog or your Library. This feature does not provide a search for both and will give you a “No Results” answer if you pick the wrong one.<br /><br />
This search bar is unnecessarily complex, requires extra attention to detail and extra steps are needed to achieve the task goal.

<section  class="process2">
    <h1 class="header"> User Flow </h1><br>
    <p>
      This is the straightforward primary flow that shows how users would navigate throughout the app, utilizing a more intuitive search bar to more efficiently find their desired song, podcast, etc.
    </p>

      <h1 class="header"> Information Archetecture </h1><br><br />
      <p>
        Since I redesigned the tab bar and the search bar, I created a site map to allow users and businesses to better understand the navigation structure changes within my proposed design. The red boxes are modifications that I have made to better meet user needs.

        With the following proposed changes to the tab bar and the search function, users will now have more a streamlined, intuitive task flow.
        <br /><br />
        I was also able to identify the following additional trends while synthesizing, which if given more time, I would be interested in exploring:
        <br /><br />
        1) Integrate Apple Podcast and Apple Music into one platform<br />
        2) Make the onboarding experience more intuitive<br />
        3) Reorganize the content on each page (i.e. Browse)<br />
      </p>
      <br /><br /><br />
    <h1 class="header">Reflection and Learning</h1><br /><br />

  <b><p class="white-text">
    1) Helping My Users Discover</b><br /><br />
   When initially embarking on my research, I asked the users directly if they had any issues with iOS stock apps - to which they most often answered: "I don't know." That's when I realized that sometimes, users aren't actively aware of their own frustrations. It wasn't until I switched over from interviews to contextual inquiry that the users and I were able to discover problems together in real time. This experience really hammered home the importance of empowering users during the research process - to let them lead us (as designers) to the real problems to solve.
  </p><br /><br />
  <b> <p class="white-text">  2) Value of Users Time</b><br /><br />
 I underestimated how difficult it would be to coordinate multiple users time constraints on my own. The online surveys provided me with an alternative that fit within my own time constraints (of the sprint) while also being more convenient and accessible for my users.
    I used surveys because I didnt know how hard it would be to secure users time early - which as a takeaway teaches me the importance of heavily valuing my users schedules, sometimes more than my own. </p>
